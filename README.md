# IBM_DataScience_Capstone_SpaceX
## Introduction
###
In this capstone project, we will predict the likelihood of a successful landing for the Falcon 9’s first stage. SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 launches at $62 million, significantly lower than other providers, who charge upwards of $165 million per launch. Much of SpaceX’s cost savings comes from reusing the first stage. By predicting whether the first stage will land successfully, we can estimate launch costs—valuable information for a company looking to compete with SpaceX.

In this project, you will take on the role of a Data Scientist at a startup aiming to challenge SpaceX. You’ll go through the entire data science process, including data collection, wrangling, exploratory analysis, visualization, model development, evaluation, and presenting your findings to stakeholders. Your goal: to predict if SpaceX’s Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully.
## Problem
###
SpaceX offers Falcon 9 rocket launches at $62 million, significantly less than other providers who charge over $165 million. This cost reduction is largely due to SpaceX’s ability to reuse the rocket’s first stage. By accurately predicting the likelihood of a successful first-stage landing, you can estimate launch costs more precisely. Your data science insights and models will help the competing startup you’re working for make smarter, more competitive bids against SpaceX for rocket launches.
##Objective
###
To use data science tools and machine learning to predict the likelihood of a successful landing for the rocket’s first stage, thereby estimating the launch cost.

Furthermore, explore the data to gain deeper insights and uncover patterns that can enhance prediction accuracy.
## Outcome
###
Develop accurate predictive algorithms to assess the likelihood of a successful first-stage rocket landing.

Create a comprehensive business case report for stakeholders, outlining the potential cost savings and competitive advantages.

Generate clear visualizations to illustrate key insights and model predictions, aiding stakeholder understanding and decision-making.
